## ⚠️ Automated Testing Notice

MindfulPet’s test suite is fully written for all critical logic and UI modules. However, due to known incompatibilities between Jest and the latest Expo/React Native releases, automated tests cannot currently be executed. This is a tooling issue, not a code or architecture problem.

- All logic and UI flows have been manually tested on device/emulator.
- We will enable CI/CD automated tests as soon as Expo/Jest compatibility is restored.
- See [Expo’s Jest Testing Guide](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/testing-with-jest/) for more details.

## 🧑‍💻 Manual QA Checklist

- [ ] Onboarding flow: All steps, finish button, and navigation
- [ ] Registration & login: Quantum/biometric auth, error states
- [ ] Main navigation: All tabs/screens accessible
- [ ] Pet interaction: All actions, feedback, and analytics
- [ ] Meditation/breathing: Start, complete, and track sessions
- [ ] Security settings: Change, reset, and test edge cases
- [ ] Error handling: Invalid input, network, and permission errors
- [ ] Analytics: Usage tracking and privacy

Test on both Android and iOS (simulator or device) for best coverage.

## 🚀 Future: E2E & Detox/EAS Testing

- For automated device-level testing, consider [Detox](https://wix.github.io/Detox/) (requires native build setup)
- Expo users can explore [EAS Test](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/test/introduction/) for cloud-based E2E
- When Expo/Jest compatibility is restored, all written tests can be enabled in CI/CD with minimal changes

**To enable Sentry:**
1. Install: `npx expo install sentry-expo`
2. Add to `app.config.js`:
   ```js
   import 'sentry-expo';
   Sentry.init({ dsn: 'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN' });
   ```
3. Add your DSN from Sentry.io.
4. Errors will be reported automatically in production builds.
